The network package defines interfaces and provides utilities for network layer (OSI layer 3) functionalities. For
example, you can use the [IPDevice] interface to read and write IP packets from a physical or virtual network device.

In addition, the sub-packages include user-space network stack implementations (such as [network/lwip2transport]) that
can translate raw IP packets into TCP/UDP flows. You can implement a [PacketProxy] to handle UDP traffic, and a
[transport.StreamDialer] to handle TCP traffic.
