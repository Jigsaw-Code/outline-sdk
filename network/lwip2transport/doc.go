The network/lwip2transport package translates between IP packets and TCP/UDP protocols. It uses a [modified lwIP go
library], which is based on the original [lwIP library] (A Lightweight TCP/IP stack). The device is singleton, so only
one instance can be created per process.

To configure the instance with TCP/UDP handlers:

	// tcpHandler will be used to handle TCP streams, and udpHandler to handle UDP packets
	t2s, err := lwip2transport.ConfigureDevice(tcpHandler, udpHandler)
	if err != nil {
		// handle error
	}
