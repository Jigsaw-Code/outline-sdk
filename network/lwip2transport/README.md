# LwIP Packet Traversal Sequence

This document tracks the traversal of packets through the `lwip2transport` LwIP network stack implementation, bridging the local host's TUN device and a remote proxy socket.

## Architecture & State Management

Before looking at the packet flows, it is important to understand how associations (connections) are managed between the TUN interface and the proxy.

* **Global Map (`udpConns`)**: The association state is managed by a global map of active connections, keyed by the source address.
* **`UDPConn`**: Represents a single association. It stores the necessary state, primarily the destination local IP, determining where return packets should be sent.
* **Association Lifecycle**: 
  - **Created**: When `udpRecvFn` receives a packet from a new source address.
  - **Closed**: Explicitly closed by the application (e.g., in `udpHandler.closeSession()`) or when the entire LwIP stack is shut down. The LwIP stack does *not* automatically time out or close these UDP associations. If a `UDPConn` is closed, the next packet from that source will simply create a new one.

## 1. Outbound Flow (Send Sequence): Local TUN Device to Proxy

This flow handles packets originating from the local device and heading out to the internet via the proxy.

        URF->>Handler: ReceiveTo(udpConn, payload, destAddr)
        Note over Handler: If new session:<br/>Calls proxy.NewSession(respWriter)<br/>Starts Proxy read loop.

        Proxy->>Remote: Send payload via Proxy socket
    end
```

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough

#### 1. Read from Local TUN
The VPN application runs a continuous loop reading outbound IP packets from the host OS TUN device. (On Apple, the client calls [NEPacketTunnelFlow.readPackets](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension/nepackettunnelflow/readpackets(completionhandler:)) and gets a callback from the OS instead of reading directly from the TUN device).

#### 2. Write to `lwIPDevice`
The app writes the IP packet to the `lwIPDevice` (`lwIPDevice.Write`).

#### 3. Ingested by LwIP
`lwIPDevice.Write` pushes the raw packet into the LwIP stack (`LWIPStack.Write` which calls LwIP's `input()` function). 

#### 4. LwIP Processing & `udpRecvFn`
LwIP processes the IP headers. For UDP packets, it invokes the Go-exported callback `udpRecvFn` (`go-tun2socks.udp_callback_export`). 
* `udpRecvFn` handles the association logic. It queries the global `udpConns` map using the packet's source address. 
* If no association exists, it creates a new `UDPConn` (via `newUDPConn`), which registers the local and remote addresses.

#### 5. Hand-off to `UDPConnHandler`
`udpRecvFn` then calls the `ReceiveTo` method on the globally registered `UDPConnHandler`, passing the `UDPConn`, the payload, and the destination address.

#### 6. Session Creation & Proxying
`UDPConnHandler.ReceiveTo` checks if a proxy session exists for this `UDPConn`. 
* If new, it creates a `udpConnResponseWriter` and calls `proxy.NewSession()`, which typically spins up a background goroutine to listen for returning proxy traffic.
* It then delegates the payload to the proxy sender (`reqSender.WriteTo`), which writes it to the remote server via the proxy socket.

## 2. Inbound Flow (Receive Sequence): Proxy to Local TUN Device

This flow handles return traffic from the remote server, through the proxy, back to the local TUN device.

    participant TUN as Local TUN Device

    Note over Dev: Blocks waiting for packet on<br/>d.rdBuf channel.

    loop Proxy Listener
        Remote->>Proxy: Receive response payload
        Proxy->>RW: WriteFrom(payload, sourceAddr)
        Note over RW: Resolves net.Addr to *net.UDPAddr
        RW->>LWIP: udpConn.WriteFrom(payload, srcAddr)
        Note over LWIP: udpConn calls C.udp_sendto().<br/>LwIP encapsulates UDP payload<br/>into an IP packet using<br/>associated local IP.
        LWIP->>Dev: forwardOutgoingIPPacket(ipPacket)
        Note over Dev: Copies the IP packet and pushes it<br/>to the buffered d.rdBuf channel.
    end

    Dev-->>App: Unblocks, returns IP packet
    App->>TUN: Write IP packet to local TUN
```

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough

#### 1. App Loop Waits for Packets
The application has a loop that continuously calls `lwIPDevice.Read()`. This call blocks, waiting for packets to arrive on the `d.rdBuf` channel.

#### 2. Proxy Receives Response
The background loop (spawned during the Outbound Flow) continuously reads from the proxy socket. It receives a UDP response payload from the remote server.

#### 3. Write to `udpConnResponseWriter`
The proxy listener passes the payload to `WriteFrom(payload, sourceAddr)` on the `udpConnResponseWriter` associated with this session.

#### 4. Hand-off to `UDPConn` & LwIP
The writer resolves the source address and calls `WriteFrom` on the underlying `UDPConn`.
* `UDPConn` contains the receiving packet logic. It calls the C function `C.udp_sendto()`, passing the payload along with the local and remote addresses stored in the association.
* The LwIP stack encapsulates the raw UDP payload into a full IP packet. The destination IP is determined by the local IP state held in the `UDPConn` association.

#### 5. LwIP Outputs IP Packet
Once LwIP constructs the IP packet, it calls its registered output callback: `forwardOutgoingIPPacket` (registered with `lwip.RegisterOutputFn`).

#### 6. Sent to `lwIPDevice` Read Channel
`forwardOutgoingIPPacket` copies the resulting IP packet into a pooled buffer and pushes it onto the `lwIPDevice`'s buffered `d.rdBuf` channel, returning without waiting for the consumer.

Both properties matter. The copy is required because the packet aliases the C pbuf payload, which LwIP frees as soon as the output callback returns. Returning without waiting is required because **LwIP calls this callback while holding its global stack lock**, which the inbound path also needs for every packet passed to `stack.Write` — waiting for the consumer here serializes the whole stack behind the consumer's write and starves the reader. Once `d.rdBuf` is full the callback does block, which is intended backpressure: the consumer is genuinely slower than the stack is producing.

Consumers take the packet either through `Read`, or through `lwIPDevice.WriteTo(w)` which writes each packet to `w` on the caller's own goroutine (this is what the Outline clients do with their TUN file). Whichever path is used, the buffer is returned to the pool afterwards. 

#### 7. Read by App & Written to TUN
The blocked `lwIPDevice.Read()` call (from Step 1) unblocks, copies the packet from `d.rdBuf`, and returns it to the application loop. The application then writes this complete IP packet back to the host OS local TUN interface.
