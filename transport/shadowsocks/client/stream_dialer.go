	// ShadowsocksStreamDialer has an optimization to send the initial client payload along with
	// the Shadowsocks connection request.  This saves one packet during connection, and also
	// reduces the distinctiveness of the connection pattern.
	//
	// Normally, the initial payload will be sent as soon as the socket is connected,
	// except for delays due to inter-process communication.  However, some protocols
	// expect the server to send data first, in which case there is no client payload.
	// We therefore use a short delay by default (10ms), longer than any reasonable IPC but shorter than
	// typical network latency.  (In an Android emulator, the 90th percentile delay
	// was ~1 ms.)  If no client payload is received by this time, we connect without it.

// The Shadowsocks StreamDialer returns a connection after the connection to the proxy is established,
// but before the connection to the target is established. That means we cannot signal "connection refused"
// or "connection timeout" errors from the target to the application.
//
// This behavior breaks IPv6 Happy Eyeballs because the application IPv6 socket will connect successfully,
// even if the proxy fails to connect to the IPv6 destination. The broken Happy Eyeballs behavior makes
// IPv6 unusable if the proxy cannot use IPv6.
//
// We can't easily fix that issue because Shadowsocks, unlike SOCKS, does not have a way to indicate
// whether the target connection is successful. Even if that was possible, we want to wait until we have
// initial data from the application in order to send the Shadowsocks salt, SOCKS address and initial data
// all in one packet. This makes the size of the initial packet hard to predict, avoiding packet size
// fingerprinting. We can only get the application initial data if we return a connection first.
