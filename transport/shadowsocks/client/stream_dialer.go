// This code contains an optimization to send the initial client payload along with
// the Shadowsocks handshake.  This saves one packet during connection, and also
// reduces the distinctiveness of the connection pattern.
//
// Normally, the initial payload will be sent as soon as the socket is connected,
// except for delays due to inter-process communication.  However, some protocols
// expect the server to send data first, in which case there is no client payload.
// We therefore use a short delay, longer than any reasonable IPC but shorter than
// typical network latency.  (In an Android emulator, the 90th percentile delay
// was ~1 ms.)  If no client payload is received by this time, we connect without it.

// Dial implements StreamDialer.Dial via a Shadowsocks server.
//
// The Shadowsocks StreamDialer returns a connection after the connection to the proxy is established,
// but before the connection to the target is established. That means we cannot signal "connection refused"
// or "connection timeout" errors from the target to the application.
//
// This behavior breaks IPv6 Happy Eyeballs because the application IPv6 socket will connect successfully,
// even if the proxy fails to connect to the IPv6 destination. The broken Happy Eyeballs behavior makes
// IPv6 unusable if the proxy cannot use IPv6.
//
// We can't easily fix that issue because Shadowsocks, unlike SOCKS, does not have a way to indicate
// whether the target connection is successful. Even if that was possible, we want to wait until we have
// initial data from the application in order to send the Shadowsocks salt, SOCKS address and initial data
// all in one packet. This makes the size of the initial packet hard to predict, avoiding packet size
// fingerprinting. We can only get the application initial data if we return a connection first.
