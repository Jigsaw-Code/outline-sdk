# How to contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project.

Please review [Google's Open Source Community Guidelines](https://opensource.google/conduct/).

## Contribution process

If you don't know what to contribute, a good start is to go over the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-sdk/issues).

For new features, it's best to share your idea first before going too deep into the implementation,
so we can align on the design.

* If there's a feature request open, share your proposal there.
* Otherwise, start with a discussion on [API Proposals](https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-sdk/discussions/categories/api-proposals).

For bug fixes, you can send a PR directly.

### Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

### Sign our Contributor License Agreement

## Repository structure

The repository has two Go modules:

* The root (`/`) module, where all the basic definitions and stable libraries live
* The `/x` module, where higher-level code, extensions and experimental libraries live.

New libraries should start in the `x/` module. We encourage you to create an example in `x/examples` or extend
one of the tools in `x/tools/` to demonstrate your feature.

Only low-level libraries that have been validated should move to the root module.

You cannot make atomic changes across module boundaries. If you need to change both the root and `x` modules
You need to first change root, merge, then you can refer to it in `x`.
Module `x` has a pinned version of the root module in its [`go.mod`](./x/go.mod) file.

To build and run code in the `x` module, you have to enter the `x` folder, or use `go -C x` flag from the repository root.
For example:

```sh
go run -C x ./tools/fetch https://ipinfo.io
```

Or

```sh
go -C x mod tidy
```

## Write Go Documentation

Writing and improving existing documentation is a good way to start with contributions.

The best way to ensure you got the Go doc formatting right is to visualize it.
To visualize the Go documentation you wrote, run:

```sh
go tool pkgsite -dev
```

Then open http://localhost:8080 on your browser. The `-dev` flag is optional and enables developer mode, reloading content on changes.

## Style

We use the standard Go style. Use `gofmt -w <path>` tool to make sure the style is correct.

## Cross-platform Development

### Building

In Go you can compile for other target operating system and architecture by specifying the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables and using the [`go build` command](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Compile_packages_and_dependencies). That only works if you are not using [Cgo](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/cgo) to call C code.

<details>
  <summary>Examples</summary>

MacOS example:

```console
% GOOS=darwin go build -C x -o ./bin/ ./examples/test-connectivity 
% file ./x/bin/test-connectivity 
./x/bin/test-connectivity: Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64
```

Linux example:

```console
% GOOS=linux go build -C x -o ./bin/ ./examples/test-connectivity 
% file ./x/bin/test-connectivity                      
./x/bin/test-connectivity: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, Go BuildID=n0WfUGLum4Y6OpYxZYuz/lbtEdv_kvyUCd3V_qOqb/CC_6GAQqdy_ebeYTdn99/Tk_G3WpBWi8vxqmIlIuU, with debug_info, not stripped
```

Windows example:

```console
% GOOS=windows go build -C x -o ./bin/ ./examples/test-connectivity 
% file ./x/bin/test-connectivity.exe 
./x/bin/test-connectivity.exe: PE32+ executable (console) x86-64 (stripped to external PDB), for MS Windows
```

### Running Android binaries

To run Android binaries, you must have an Android simulator running or a physical device plugged in.

The easiest way is to run a binary is to use the [`go run` command](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Compile_and_run_Go_program) directly with the `-exec` flag and our convenience tool `run_on_android.sh`:

```sh
GOOS=android GOARCH=arm64 go -C x run -exec "$(pwd)/run_on_android.sh" ./tools/resolve --resolver 8.8.8.8 example.com
```

It also works with the [`go test` command](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Test_packages):

```sh
GOOS=android GOARCH=arm64 go test -exec "$(pwd)/run_on_android.sh"  ./...
```

To build with [cgo](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/cgo) on Android, you need to set the `CC` environment variable to point to the `clang` compiler in the Android NDK.
The path to the C compiler depends on your Android NDK version, host OS, and target architecture. You can find the correct path within the NDK's `toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/` directory.

For example, to run a tool on a 64-bit ARM Android 30 device from macOS:

```sh
CC="$ANDROID_HOME/ndk/21.3.6528147/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/darwin-x86_64/bin/aarch64-linux-android30-clang" CGO_ENABLED=1 GOOS=android GOARCH=arm64 go -C x run -exec "$(pwd)/run_on_android.sh" ./tools/fetch "https://example.com"
```


<details>
  <summary>Details and direct invocation</summary>

The `run_on_android.sh` script uses the [Android Debug Bridge (`adb`)](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb) to run the binary on a connected Android device (physical or emulator). You must have `adb` in your `PATH`. You can check for connected devices using `adb devices`:

```console
% adb devices
List of devices attached
emulator-5554	device
```

The script will:
1. Push the binary to a temporary location on the device (`/data/local/tmp/test/`).
2. Execute the binary on the device with the provided arguments.
3. Remove the binary from the device after execution.

### Running Linux binaries

To run Linux binaries you can use a Linux container via [Podman](https://podman.io/).

#### Set up podman
<details>
  <summary>Instructions</summary>

[Install Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation) (once). On macOS:

```sh
brew install podman
```

Create the podman service VM (once) with the [`podman machine init` command](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-machine-init.1.html):

```sh
podman machine init
```

Start the VM with the [`podman machine start` command](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-machine-start.1.html), after every time it is stopped:

```sh
podman machine start
```

You can see the VM running with the [`podman machine list` command](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-machine-list.1.html):

```console
% podman machine list
NAME                     VM TYPE     CREATED        LAST UP            CPUS        MEMORY      DISK SIZE
podman-machine-default*  qemu        3 minutes ago  Currently running  1           2.147GB     107.4GB
```

When you are done with development, you can stop the machine with the [`podman machine stop` command](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-machine-stop.1.html):

```sh
podman machine stop
```

</details>

#### Run

The easiest way is to run a binary is to use the [`go run` command](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Compile_and_run_Go_program) directly with the `-exec` flag and our convenience tool `run_on_podman.sh`:

```sh
GOOS=linux go run -C x -exec "$(pwd)/run_on_podman.sh" ./examples/test-connectivity
```

It also works with the [`go test` command](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Test_packages):

```sh
GOOS=linux go test -exec "$(pwd)/run_on_podman.sh"  ./...
```

<details>
  <summary>Details and direct invocation</summary>

The `run_on_podman.sh` script uses the [`podman run` command](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-run.1.html) and a minimal ["distroless" container image](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless) to run the binary you want:

```sh
podman run --arch $(uname -m) --rm -it -v "${bin}":/outline/bin gcr.io/distroless/static-debian11 /outline/bin "$@"
```

You can also use `podman run` directly to run a pre-built binary:

```console
% podman run --rm -it -v ./x/bin:/outline gcr.io/distroless/static-debian11 /outline/test-connectivity
Usage of /outline/test-connectivity:
  -domain string
        Domain name to resolve in the test (default "example.com.")
  -key string
        Outline access key
  -proto string
        Comma-separated list of the protocols to test. Muse be "tcp", "udp", or a combination of them (default "tcp,udp")
  -resolver string
        Comma-separated list of addresses of DNS resolver to use for the test (default "8.8.8.8,2001:4860:4860::8888")
  -v    Enable debug output
```

Flags explanation:

* `--rm`: Remove container (and pod if created) after exit
* `-i` (interactive): Keep STDIN open even if not attached
* `-t` (tty): Allocate a pseudo-TTY for container
* `-v` (volume): Bind mount a volume into the container. Volume source will be on the server machine, not the client

### Running Windows binaries

To run Windows binaries you can use [Wine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_(software)) to emulate a Windows environment.
This is not the same as a real Windows environment, so make sure you test on actual Windows machines.

#### Install Wine

<details>
  <summary>Instructions</summary>

Follow the instructions at https://wiki.winehq.org/Download.

On macOS:

```sh
brew tap homebrew/cask-versions
brew install --cask --no-quarantine wine-stable
```

After installation, `wine64` should be on your `PATH`. Check with `wine64 --version`:

```sh
wine64 --version
```

</details>

#### Run

You can pass `wine64` as the `-exec` parameter in the `go` calls.

To build:

```sh
GOOS=windows go run -C x -exec "wine64" ./examples/test-connectivity
```

For tests:

```sh
GOOS=windows go test -exec "wine64"  ./...
```

## Testing

All new code must be accompanied by tests. Tests should be placed in `_test.go` files alongside the code they are testing.

### Running Tests

To run all tests in the repository, run the following commands from the root of the repository:

```sh
go test -race ./...
go test -C x -race ./...
```

This will run all tests except those that have external network dependencies.

### Network Dependant Tests

Some tests have external network dependencies. These tests are tagged with the `nettest` build tag and are not run by default. To run these tests, you must include the `-tags nettest` flag. Our CI runs these tests.

For example:

```sh
go test -v -race -tags nettest
```

### Benchmarks

To run benchmarks:

```sh
go test -race -bench '.' ./... -benchtime=100ms
go -C x test -race -bench '.' ./... -benchtime=100ms
```

### Continuous Integration (CI)

All pull requests are tested on our CI system. The CI runs all tests, including `nettest`s, on Linux, macOS, and Windows. It also runs tests on an Android emulator. You can see the CI configuration in [`.github/workflows/test.yml`](.github/workflows/test.yml).
