Package config provides convenience functions to create dialer objects based on a text config.
This is experimental and mostly for illustrative purposes at this point.

Configurable transports simplifies the way you create and manage transports.
With the config package, you can use [NewPacketDialer] and [NewStreamDialer] to create dialers using a simple text string.

Key Benefits:

  - Ease of Use: Create transports effortlessly by providing a textual configuration, reducing boilerplate code.
  - Serialization: Easily share configurations with users or between different parts of your application, including your Go backend.
  - Dynamic Configuration: Set your app's transport settings at runtime.
  - DPI Evasion: Advanced nesting and configuration options help you evade Deep Packet Inspection (DPI).

# Config Format

The configuration string is composed of parts separated by the `|` symbol, which define nested dialers.
For example, `A|B` means dialer `B` takes dialer `A` as its input.
An empty string represents the direct TCP/UDP dialer, and is used as the input to the first cofigured dialer.

Each dialer configuration follows a URL format, where the scheme defines the type of Dialer. Supported formats include:

Shadowsocks proxy (compatible with Outline's access keys, package [github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-sdk/transport/shadowsocks])

	ss://[USERINFO]@[HOST]:[PORT]?prefix=[PREFIX]

SOCKS5 proxy (currently streams only, package [github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-sdk/transport/socks5])

	socks5://[USERINFO]@[HOST]:[PORT]

USERINFO field is optional and only required if username and password authentication is used. It is in the format of username:password.

Stream split transport (streams only, package [github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-sdk/transport/split])

It takes the length of the prefix. The stream will be split when PREFIX_LENGTH bytes are first written.

	split:[PREFIX_LENGTH]

TLS transport (currently streams only, package [github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-sdk/transport/tls])

The sni parameter defines the name to be sent in the TLS SNI. It can be empty.
The certname parameter defines what name to validate against the server certificate.

	tls:sni=[SNI]&certname=[CERT_NAME]

TLS fragmentation (streams only, package [github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-sdk/transport/tlsfrag]).

The Client Hello record payload will be split into two fragments of size LENGTH and len(payload)-LENGTH if LENGTH>0.
If LENGTH<0, the two fragments will be of size len(payload)-LENGTH and LENGTH respectively.
For more details, refer to [github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-sdk/transport/tlsfrag].

	tlsfrag:[LENGTH]

Address override.

This dialer configuration is helpful for testing and development or if you need to fix the domain
resolution.
The host parameter, if not empty, specifies the host to dial instead of the original host.
The port parameter, if not empty, specifies the port to dial instead of the original port.

	override:host=[HOST]&port=[PORT]

# Examples

Packet splitting - To split outgoing streams on bytes 2 and 123, you can use:

	split:2|split:123

Evading DNS and SNI blocking - A blocked site hosted on Cloudflare can potentially be accessed by resolving cloudflare.net instead of the original
domain and using stream split:

	override:host=cloudflare.net.|split:2

SOCKS5-over-TLS, with domain-fronting - To tunnel SOCKS5 over TLS, and set the SNI to decoy.example.com, while still validating against your host name, use:

	tls:sni=decoy.example.com&certname=[HOST]|socks5:[HOST]:[PORT]

Onion Routing with Shadowsocks - To route your traffic through three Shadowsocks servers, similar to [Onion Routing], use:

	ss://[USERINFO1]@[HOST1]:[PORT1]|ss://[USERINFO2]@[HOST2]:[PORT2]|ss://[USERINFO3]@[HOST3]:[PORT3]

In that case, HOST1 will be your entry node, and HOST3 will be your exit node.

DPI Evasion - To add packet splitting to a Shadowsocks server for enhanced DPI evasion, use:

	split:2|ss://[USERINFO]@[HOST]:[PORT]
