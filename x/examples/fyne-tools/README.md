# DNS System Resolver Lookup Utility

```

## Android

```
go run fyne.io/fyne/v2/cmd/fyne package -os android && adb install Net_Tools.apk
```

Note: the generated APK is around 85MB.


## Windows

If you are on Windows, you can just use the regular `go build` or `go run` command.

Because the app uses cgo, we need to cross-compilation tools to build from other platforms.

If you are on macOS, you can build the Windows app with [MinGW-x64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/).

First install MinGW-w64. MacPorts is the [official channel](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/#macports):

```
sudo port install x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc
```

With Homebrew (unofficial):

```
brew install mingw-w64
```

Build the app (64-bit):

```
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=1 CC="x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc" go build .
```

The first build will take minutes, since there's a lot of platform code to be built.
Subsequent builds will be incremental and take a few seconds.
