# Outline VPN Demo App [WIP]

Current status: I have a fullstack app being loaded in an apple and android project. This is based on the "Fullstack app in a box" pattern. You need to load the kotlin_box via android studio and the ios box via xcode.

Make sure you're setup via `kdoctor` (`brew install kdoctor`)

Desktop is stubbed out in kotlin box.
