# My Outline Web Wrapper Project

## Starting the project

```sh
npm run open:{{platform}}
```

## Adding icon and splash screen assets to the project

You'll need to add the following images to the `assets` folder:

A 1024x1024 png titled `icon.png` containing your app icon.
A 2732x2732 png titled `splash.png` containing your splash screen.
Another 2732x2732 png titled `splash-dark.png` containing your splash screen in dark mode.

Then, run the following command to generate and place the assets in the appropriate places in your iOS project:

```sh
npx capacitor-assets generate --{{platform}}
```
